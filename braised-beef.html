    <h3>Ghanaian Braised Beef</h3>
    <p>Braised beef is a deeply seasoned and tender dish cooked slowly in a rich sauce made from local spices, tomatoes, onions, and herbs. The beef is first browned to seal in flavor, then simmered gently in a spicy, aromatic mixture that brings out the essence of Ghanaian cooking. This flavorful dish is perfect with rice, boiled yam, plantain, or banku. It’s a comfort meal that combines traditional taste with a soft, melt-in-the-mouth texture.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
2 pounds beef
2 tablespoons vegetable oil or palm oil
2 large onions (1 chopped, 1 blended)
3 medium tomatoes (blended)
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 tablespoon ginger paste
1 tablespoon garlic paste
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon ground cloves (pepre)
1 teaspoon paprika or suya spice
1 teaspoon curry powder
1 teaspoon thyme (fresh or dried)
1 scotch bonnet pepper (blended or chopped)
1 bay leaf
1 cup beef stock or water
Salt to taste
    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
1. Prepare the beef: Wash and cut beef into medium chunks. Season with salt, black pepper, ginger, garlic, cloves, and suya spice. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes.
2. Sear the beef: Heat oil in a pot. Brown the beef on all sides to lock in flavor, then remove and set aside.
3. Make the base sauce: In the same pot, add chopped onions and fry until golden. Add tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes. Then add the blended tomatoes, blended onion, and scotch bonnet pepper. Cook until the sauce thickens and the oil begins to separate.
4. Add spices: Stir in curry powder, thyme, and the seasoning cube. Mix well.
5. Add the beef: Return the browned beef to the pot, stir to coat it well with the sauce.
6. Add liquid: Pour in beef stock or water until it just covers the meat. Add bay leaf, then cover and cook on low heat for 2–3 hours, stirring occasionally.
7. Finish cooking: Once the beef is tender and the sauce is rich and thick, taste and adjust seasoning if needed.
8. Serve: Serve hot with boiled rice, yam, plantain, or any preferred side dish.
