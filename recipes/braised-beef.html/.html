    <h3>Ghanaian Braised Beef</h3>
    <p>Braised beef is a deeply seasoned and tender dish cooked slowly in a rich sauce made from local spices, tomatoes, onions, and herbs. The beef is first browned to seal in flavor, then simmered gently in a spicy, aromatic mixture that brings out the essence of Ghanaian cooking. This flavorful dish is perfect with rice, boiled yam, plantain, or banku. It’s a comfort meal that combines traditional taste with a soft, melt-in-the-mouth texture.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
<li>2 pounds beef</li>
<li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil or palm oil</li>
 <li>2 large onions (1 chopped, 1 blended)</li>
 <li>3 medium tomatoes (blended)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
<li>1 tablespoon ginger paste</li>
<li>1 tablespoon garlic paste</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground cloves (pepre)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon paprika or suya spice</li>
<li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon thyme (fresh or dried)</li>
<li>1 scotch bonnet pepper (blended or chopped)</li>
<li>1 bay leaf</li>
<li>1 cup beef stock or water</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>  
    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Prepare the beef: Wash and cut beef into medium chunks. Season with salt, black pepper, ginger, garlic, cloves, and suya spice. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes</li>
<li>Sear the beef: Heat oil in a pot. Brown the beef on all sides to lock in flavor, then remove and set aside.</li>
<li>Make the base sauce: In the same pot, add chopped onions and fry until golden. Add tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes. Then add the blended tomatoes, blended onion, and scotch bonnet pepper. Cook until the sauce thickens and the oil begins to separate.</li>
<li>Add spices: Stir in curry powder, thyme, and the seasoning cube. Mix well.</li>
<li>Add the beef: Return the browned beef to the pot, stir to coat it well with the sauce.</li>
<li>Add liquid: Pour in beef stock or water until it just covers the meat. Add bay leaf, then cover and cook on low heat for 2–3 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
<li>Finish cooking: Once the beef is tender and the sauce is rich and thick, taste and adjust seasoning if needed.</li>
<li>Serve: Serve hot with boiled rice, yam, plantain, or any preferred side dish.</li>
